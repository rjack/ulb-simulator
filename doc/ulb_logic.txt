Overview: from loopback interface to best wlan interface
          periodic output to wlan interfaces
          from any wlan interface to loopback interface

  NO QOS

Events:

RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from LOOPBACK-INTERFACE,
              flushes RTP-PACKET to first WLAN-INTERFACE


RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
              don't process RTP-PACKET
              flushes RTP-PACKET to LOOPBACK-INTERFACE



  BASIC QOS (as described by Dott. Ghini's paper)

Events:

RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from LOOPBACK-INTERFACE
              don't process RTP-PACKET
	      if best-interface
	         flushes RTP-PACKET to best-interface
	      else
	         discard RTP-PACKET


RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
              process RTP-PACKET
	      ; e.g. mark WLAN-INTERFACE as working
	      flushes RTP-PACKET to LOOPBACK-INTERFACE


RECEIVE-EVENT takes NETLINK-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
              process NETLINK-PACKET
	      ; e.g. if ack mark WLAN-INTERFACE as working
	      ;      else mark WLAN-INTERFACE as suspected
              discard NETLINK-PACKET


SEND-EVENT outputs RTP-PACKET through WLAN-INTERFACE

SEND-EVENT outputs RTP-PACKET through LOOPBACK-INTERFACE

Events:

RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from LOOPBACK-INTERFACE
              process RTP-PACKET : set it as non-urgent
	      if best-interface
                 flush RTP-PACKET to best interface
              else
                 discard RTP-PACKET


RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
	      process RTP-PACKET : log arrival in wlan's log
	      flush RTP-PACKET to LOOPBACK-INTERFACE


RECEIVE-EVENT takes RAW-DATA from WLAN-INTERFACE
	      process RAW-DATA : log ping informations in wlan's log
	      discard RAW-DATA


RECEIVE-EVENT takes NETLINK-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
	      process NETLINK-PACKET : log ack or nak in wlan's log
                                       process the associated rtp-packet
				       (e.g. discard if ACK, set urgent if NAK)
	      discard NETLINK-PACKET


SEND-EVENT outputs RTP-PACKET through LOOPBACK-INTERFACE


SEND-EVENT outputs RTP-PACKET through WLAN-INTERFACE
	   process RTP-PACKET : log sending in wlan's log


SEND-EVENT outputs RAW-DATA through WLAN-INTERFACE
	   process RAW-DATA : log ping sending in wlan's log
