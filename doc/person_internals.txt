			       PERSON INTERNALS

Channels:

Mouth and ears = full duplex channel.

(note: nothing prevents a person from speaking and hearing at the same time,
the "hear then speak" behaviour is just common sense and should ipotetically
be modeled in the person logic)

No need for output and input queues.

Input objects are discarded.
Output objects are generated on the fly.
Channel output locked for voice duration.

Assertions:

- When outputting voice, channel must not be found locked.
  If this happens, there was an error generating the conversation timings.
