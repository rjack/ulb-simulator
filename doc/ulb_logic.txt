Overview: from loopback interface to best wlan interface
          periodic output to wlan interfaces
          from any wlan interface to loopback interface
	                          change internal state


  NO QOS

Events:

RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from LOOPBACK-INTERFACE,
              flushes RTP-PACKET to first WLAN-INTERFACE

RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
              don't process RTP-PACKET
              flushes RTP-PACKET to LOOPBACK-INTERFACE



  BASIC QOS (as described by Dott. Ghini's paper)

Events:

RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from LOOPBACK-INTERFACE
              don't process RTP-PACKET
              flushes RTP-PACKET to best interface


RECEIVE-EVENT takes RTP-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
              process RTP-PACKET
	      flushes RTP-PACKET to LOOPBACK-INTERFACE


RECEIVE-EVENT takes NETLINK-PACKET from WLAN-INTERFACE
              process NETLINK-PACKET
	      ; e.g. if ack mark WLAN-INTERFACE as working
	      ;      else mark WLAN-INTERFACE as suspected


SEND-EVENT outputs RTP-PACKET through WLAN-INTERFACE

SEND-EVENT outputs RTP-PACKET through LOOPBACK-INTERFACE
